# TimeSeries4
Overview
The TimeSeries.ipynb notebook provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing time series data, focusing on gold prices from 2018 to 2021. It covers data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend and seasonality analysis, and stationarity testing. The notebook uses Python's pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries to visualize and analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in the dataset.

Features
1. Data Loading
Reads multiple Excel files (2018â€“2021) containing gold price data using pandas and merges them into a single DataFrame.

Sets the DATE column as the index for time series analysis.

2. Data Cleaning
Handles missing values and duplicates.

Sorts data by date for chronological analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Generates summary statistics for the dataset.

Univariate Analysis:

Distribution plot of gold prices to identify skewness.

Boxplot to detect outliers.

Trend Analysis:

Line plots to observe irregular trends over time.

Calendar heatmaps using the calplot library for visualizing yearly trends.

4. Seasonality Analysis
Breaks down the data by year and month to identify seasonal patterns.

Visualizes monthly and yearly variations using boxplots and point plots.

5. Stationarity Testing
Performs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check for stationarity.

Visualizes rolling mean and standard deviation to assess trends over time.

6. Time Series Decomposition
Decomposes the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components using the seasonal_decompose method from statsmodels.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

pandas: For data manipulation.

numpy: For numerical computations.

matplotlib: For plotting graphs.

seaborn: For advanced visualizations.

statsmodels: For time series decomposition and stationarity testing.

calplot: For calendar heatmaps.

Installation
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels calplot
Usage Instructions
Clone or download the notebook file to your local machine.

Place the gold price data files (gold2018.xlsx, gold2019.xlsx, etc.) in the appropriate directory.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

Key Sections
Data Exploration
Head and Tail: Displays initial rows of merged data for inspection.

Null Values: Identifies missing values using .isnull().sum().

Duplicates: Counts duplicate rows using .duplicated().sum().

Visualization Examples
Line Plot:

Observes long-term trends in gold prices.

Example:

python
sns.lineplot(x='DATE', y='Price', data=df)
Observation: Irregular trends with exponential patterns.

Boxplots:

Monthly price variations across years:

python
sns.boxplot(x=df['Month'], y=df['Price'], palette='rainbow')
Calendar Heatmap:

Visualizes yearly price trends using:

python
calplot.calplot(df['Price'])
Decomposition Plot:

Breaks down time series into components:

python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
decomposition = seasonal_decompose(df['Price'], model='additive', period=10)
decomposition.plot()
Observations
Gold prices exhibit an irregular trend with troughs and crests over time.

Seasonal patterns are evident, especially in January when prices tend to rise across years.

Stationarity test results indicate non-stationary behavior due to increasing rolling mean values.

Future Improvements
Implement forecasting models such as ARIMA or Prophet for predictive analysis.

Add more granular analysis at weekly or daily levels for better insights.

Explore advanced techniques like Fourier transforms for deeper trend analysis.
